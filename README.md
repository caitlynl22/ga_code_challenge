# GA Code Challenge React App

Since I do have some React experience and I understand that the intention is to move toward teaching students React, I decided to rewrite the app in React.

## Benefits
- From industry experience, I know that React is increasingly popular, much more than any other JS framework at the moment.
- React is modular and thus extendable (it's fairly trivial to add new components) and maintainable.
- Use of the Virtual DOM makes React faster, as it manipulates only the parts of the DOM that change.
- From a UI perspective, it makes sense and enforces UI patterns with its component structure.
- Opens the door to developing mobile apps (somewhere down the road).

## Challenges
- Different usages and patterns can make learning confusing.
- Adding Redux on top of React adds another challenge (not necessary, but very common).
- Beyond the usual vocabulary and workflows to learn that comes with any framework, is relatively easy to pick up, as JS frameworks go.
